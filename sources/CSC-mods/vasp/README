Step by step guide to install full charge self-consistent DFTwDMFT calculation in VASP
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


(1) Generate libdmft.a by the Compiling sources code that will  be needed to link DMFTwDFT to DFT codes to enable full charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT calculations. 

(2) Change the VASP makefile file. Specify libraries and/or objects to be linked against, in the usual ways:


FIND and CHANGE: 

LLIBS += -Lparser -lparser -lstdc++ /home/uthpala/wannier90/wannier90-1.2/libwannier.a
         /home/uthpala/Dropbox/git/DMFTwDFT/sources/libdmft.a



(3) Before modifying the source code of VASP, we first need to install the VASP as it is. The user should follow the VASP installation instructions from the VASP web site.


(4) First copy the modified mlwf.F VASP file from the sources/CSC-mods directory to the VASP source directory and install the VASP again. This step will create some dependenices for next step.


(5) Next, copy the other modified/required VASP files such as charge.F,  electron.F,  main.F, and us.F from the sources/CSC-mods directory to the VASP source directory.


(6)  Finally, recompile VASP. Then rename this vasp executable to vaspDMFT and copy it to teh DMFTwDFT/bin directory.
