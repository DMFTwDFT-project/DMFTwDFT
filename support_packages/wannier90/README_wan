The newest version can be downloaded from wannier.org web cite: http://www.wannier.org/download/
Requirements: A Fortran 95 compiler (most f90 compilers are really f95)
               LAPACK and BLAS libraries
               (Optional) MPI libraries for parallel execution of the
                  postw90.x executable

 Configuration:
   The system dependent parameters (e.g. compiler name) are contained in a file
   called 'make.inc'. Sample files may be found in the ./config/ directory.
   Choose one that is nearest to your setup and copy it to make.inc. You may
   need to edit it, for example to give the correct library path for your
   machine.

    On a linux system with the intel compiler build Wannier90 by typing

         cp ./config/make.inc.ifort ./make.inc
         make
