PyChemia, Python Framework for Materials Discovery and Design:
============================================================
PyChemia is an open-source Python Library for materials structural search. The purpose of the initiative is to create a method agnostic framework for materials discovery and design using a variety of methods from Minima Hoping to Soft-computing based methods. PyChemia is also a library for data-mining, using several methods to discover interesting candidates among the materials already processed.






The code is hosted on

Installation
============

You can install pychemia in several ways. We are showing 3 ways of
installing PyChemia inside a Virtual environment. A virtual environment
is a good way of isolating software packages from the pacakges installed
with the Operating System. The decision on which method to use
depends if you want to use the most recent code or the package uploaded
from time to time to PyPi. The last method is particularly suited for
developers who want to change the code and get those changes operative without
an explicit instalation.


Installing with pip from pypi.org on a virtual environment 
----------------------------------------------------------

This method installs PyChemia from the packages uploaded
to PyPi every month. It will provides a version of 
PyChemia that is stable.

First, create and activate the virtual environment.
We are using the name `pychemia_ve`, but that is arbitrary.

```bash
virtualenv pychemia_ve
source pychemia_ve/bin/activate
```

When the virtual environment is activated, your prompt 
changes to `(pychemia_ve)...$`. Now, install pychemia 
with pip

```bash
pip install pychemia
