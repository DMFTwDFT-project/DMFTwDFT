TO USE THE CTQMC IMPURITY SOLVER:
_________________________________

In order to compile the ctqmc impurity solver user should access sources/impurity/ctqmc directory, and just type make inside this directory. You will need only C++ & gsl libraries. However, to compile you will need to edit a bit src/Makefile.in file. 

You will need to set PC++, PFLAGS, PLIBS. For example, for MAC computer one would set:
PC++ = mpicxx
PFLAGS = -D_MPI -O3
PLIBS = -framework Accelerate -lgsl -lgslcblas
