DMFTwDFT 
=========

DMFTwDFT is an open-source, user-friendly framework to calculate electronic, vibrational and elastic properties in strongly
correlated materials (SCM) using beyond-DFT methods such as DFT+U, DFT+Hybrids and DFT+DMFT (Dynamical Mean Field Theory) with a variety of different DFT codes. Currently supports VASP, Siesta and Quantum Espresso (through Aiida).
