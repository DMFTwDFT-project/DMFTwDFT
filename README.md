DMFTwDFT 
=========

DMFTwDFT is an open-source, user-friendly framework to calculate electronic, vibrational and elastic properties in strongly
correlated materials (SCM) using beyond-DFT methods such as DFT+U, DFT+Hybrids and DFT+DMFT (Dynamical Mean Field Theory) with a variety of different DFT codes. Currently supports VASP, Siesta and Quantum Espresso (through Aiida).

Note: Users can download these external programs, as explained in the README file of each supported package folder (see folder DMFTwDFT-master/support-packages). For installation, we suggest users refer to this link: https://dmftwdft-project.github.io/DMFTwDFT/installation.html for more details. 
OR Users can run the python script "setup.py" which will automatically download and install the internal as well as external programs.

PyProcar is used as a support package to find the wannier window of the correlated orbitals. It's not necessary to be installed for DMFTwDFT.
PyChemia is required for the Python 3 version of the code which is still under development. 
For the Python 2 version this is not required.
