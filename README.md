DMFTwDFT
===========

DMFTwDFT is an open-source, user-friendly framework to calculate electronic, vibrational and elastic properties in strongly
correlated materials (SCM) using beyond-DFT methods such as DFT+U, DFT+Hybrids and DFT+DMFT (Dynamical Mean Field Theory) with a variety of different DFT codes.
