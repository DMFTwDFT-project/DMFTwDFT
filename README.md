DMFTwDFT 
=========

DMFTwDFT is an open-source, user-friendly framework to calculate electronic, vibrational and elastic properties in strongly
correlated materials (SCM) using beyond-DFT methods such as DFT+U, DFT+Hybrids and DFT+DMFT (Dynamical Mean Field Theory) with a variety of different DFT codes. Currently supports VASP, Siesta and Quantum Espresso.

Installation and usage
----------------------

Please refer to the documentation.

https://dmftwdft-project.github.io/DMFTwDFT/

**Quick Install:**

Copy Makefile.in from the ``config`` directory for the desired compiler to the DMFTwDFT root directory and do:

```bash
 python setup.py {gfortran, intel}
```

Note:

For gnu compilers, it is assumed that liblapack.a, libblas.a and gsl libraries are installed in the ``/usr/local/lib/`` directory. If not, modify Makefile.in to point to the correct location.

**Note:**

Users can download these external programs, as explained in the README file of each supported package folder (see folder DMFTwDFT-master/support-packages). For installation, we suggest users refer to this link: https://dmftwdft-project.github.io/DMFTwDFT/installation.html for more details. 
OR Users can run the python script "setup.py" which will automatically download and install the internal as well as external programs.

PyProcar is used as a support package to find the wannier window of the correlated orbitals. It's not necessary to be installed for DMFTwDFT.
PyChemia is required for the Python 3 version of the code which is still under development. 
For the Python 2 version this is not required.
